CREATE TABLE dochannels(mba,regadd,bit,bootvalue,value,ts,rule,desc,comment,mbi integer); -- one line per register bit (coil). 15 columns.  NO ts???

-- regvalue is read from register, value is the one we want the register to be (written by app). write value to register to make regvalue equal!
-- if the value is empty / None, then no control will be done, just reading the register
-- but if an output is controlled out of this table, then you can also use dichannels table to monitor that channel.
-- it is possible to combine values from different modbus slaves and registers into one service. 
-- possible status values are 0..3

-- INSERT INTO "dochannels" VALUES('9','0','8','0','0','','','output DO1','niisutus 0100',0); --  kompressor


-- the rule number column is provided just in case some application needs them. should be uniquely indexed!
-- NB but register addresses and bits can be on different lines, to be members of different services AND to be controlled by different rules!!!
-- virtual channels are also possible - these are defined with dir 2 in adichannels.
