-- if the value is empty / None, then no control will be done, just reading the register
-- but if an output is controlled out of this table, then you can also use dichannels table to monitor that channel.
-- it is possible to combine values from different modbus slaves and registers into one service.

-- the rule number column is provided just in case some application needs them. should be uniquely indexed!
-- NB but register addresses and bits can be on different lines, to be members of different services AND to be controlled by different rules!!!
-- virtual channels are also possible - these are defined with dir 2 in adichannels.
